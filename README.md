## Project Overview

With the help of CircleCI and an AWS EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster, this project operationalizes a Python Flask example web application for my blog:

1. **Continuous Integration with CircleCI**: To automate the development workflow, we have put up a CircleCI pipeline.
   - To assure code quality, we carry out code linting in the pipeline.
   - The application's Docker image is created.
   - For simple access and deployment, the Docker image is next posted to a public Docker Registry, especially Docker Hub.

2. **Kubernetes Deployment on AWS EKS**: We use AWS EKS to administer our Kubernetes cluster.
   - We set up and execute the Flask application within the EKS cluster. This enables us to manage, scale, and orchestrate containers using Kubernetes.

3. **Production Deployment and Rolling Updates**: - We use a rolling update method when it's time to push a new version of the application to production.
   - We employ a rolling update method when it's time to promote a new version of the application to production.
   - This guarantees less downtime and easy switching between versions of the program.
   - This update's orchestration is done using Kubernetes.

4. **Makefile and Shell Scripts**: 
   - We have arranged the numerous activities in this project into a Makefile to simplify and automate them. 
   - The execution of duties and project management are made easier by this organized approach.

We have built a solid workflow for building, testing, and deploying the "hello" Flask application using CircleCI, AWS EKS, Docker Hub, and Kubernetes, assuring effective development and production deployment procedures.

## Tasks

This project follows a CI/CD methodology to build a Docker image and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. Here are the key tasks within the project:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Create a virtual Python environment. create setup
   - Use the `make install` command to install all required dependencies.

2. **Code Quality Assurance**:
   - Lint the project's code to check for errors.
   - `make lint` Python code, Dockerfile, and shell scripts

3. **Docker Image Creation**:
   - Create a Dockerfile to containerize the "hello" application: `Dockerfile`

4. **Docker Image Deployment**:
   - Deploy the containerized application to a public Docker Registry, specifically Docker Hub.

5. **Kubernetes Cluster Deployment**:
   - Use the command `make create-cluster` to deploy a Kubernetes cluster.

6. **Application Deployment in Kubernetes**:
   - Make the application available to the Kubernetes cluster by using the `make deployment` command.

7. **Rolling Updates**:
   - Implement an update strategy for the application within the cluster using a rolling-update approach: `make rolling`


This CI/CD project automates the entire software development lifecycle, from code quality checks to deployment in a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring efficient development and deployment processes.

## CI/CD Tools and Cloud Services:

1. **Circle CI**: A cloud-based CI/CD service.
2. **Amazon AWS**: A provider of cloud services.
3. **AWS EKS**: Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service, a managed Kubernetes service.
4. **AWS eksctl**: The official CLI tool for Amazon EKS.
5. **AWS CLI**: A command-line tool for interacting with AWS services.
6. **CloudFormation**: An Infrastructure as Code service for AWS.
7. **kubectl**: A command-line tool for controlling Kubernetes clusters.
8. **Docker Hub**: A container image repository service.

- **bin**: This directory seems to contain various scripts and utility files for managing and deploying your application.
  - `build-docker.sh`: A script for building a Docker image.
  - `cleanup.sh`: A script for cleaning up resources or temporary files.
  - `create-cluster.sh`: A script for creating a Kubernetes cluster.
  - `deployment.sh`: A script for managing deployments.
  - `install-docker.sh`: A script for installing Docker.
  - `install-eksctl.sh`: A script for installing the EKS (Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service) CLI tool.
  - `install-kubectl.sh`: A script for installing `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command-line tool.
  - `rollback.sh`: A script for rolling back deployments.
  - `rolling.sh`: A script for managing rolling updates.
  - `run-docker.sh`: A script for running a Docker container.
  - `set_env.sh`: A script for setting environment variables.
  - `update-config-eks.sh`: A script for updating EKS configurations.
  - `upload-docker.sh`: A script for uploading Docker images.
  
The Makefile triggers the execution of the following shell scripts:

```create-cluster.sh```: creates the EKS cluster

```install-eksctl.sh```: installs the eksctl tool

```install-kubectl.sh```: installs the kubectl tool

```create-cluster.sh```: Create cluster

```deployment.sh```: deploys and exposes a service in the K8S cluster
